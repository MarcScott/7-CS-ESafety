* Building the circuit
- The PCBs you are using have been protected with a silkscreen. This should make the job of soldering them easier to complete.
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
** Research It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
- Look up the terms silkscreen, tin plating and solder mask in relation to PCBs and find out what they mean.
** Record it
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: record
:END:
- Open a Word or Powerpoint document and add your research on silkscreens, tin plating and solder masks.
** Build It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- Below is a picture of a fully assembled PCB. There should also be a demo model available for you to examine.
- Use the images and the circuit design from the previous section, to place and solder your components to the board.
- The components sit on the side with the images.

** Badge It - Silver/Gold
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- Take pictures as you solder your PCB circuit, to ensure you have a record of the progress you have made.
- Add at least two, front and back, photos of your circuit board to Word / Powerpoint. 
- The quality of both your soldering and research will determine the badge awarded.
