- The 555 timer will produce a pulse from the output to the speaker. The frequency of the pulse depends on the resistance of the circuit.
- Watch this video on what makes a low and high pitched sound.

Research and collate your findings into a written report or presentation on a fully electronic music instrument such as:

- Moog modular synthesiser
- Theremin
- Stylophone

- Here is a nice [[http://makezine.com/2015/08/26/six-electronic-instruments-power-eardrums/][site]] which has both old and new electronic instruments.
- And one we could [[http://www.instructables.com/id/Light-Theremin/?ALLSTEPS][build]] as an extension task.
** Badge It - Platinum

For your chosen instrument explain:

- How does it work?
- How do you play it?
- Can you find an image?
- Can you find a sound/video file?

- Finally upload your work for the badge.
